# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal website that will hold information and links to my other projects I've completed.
As I continue to learn about web development, I hope to add more to this project.
This site will serve to be an expression of myself and my interests.

## I Want To

! Add a link to download CV/Resume.
! Redo the headers for each modal.
! Implement a responsive email form to replace the mailto link.
[tried to implement on before but my knowledge of CSS is limited to make it how I want.]
Add a dark mode toggle.
Make more animations.

## Known Bugs

Under projects, portfolio repo link doesn't link to github repository.

Fix accidental scrolling of main page while other modals are open.

On Mobile, when the site first loads, the footer's height expands and does not shrink until multiple reloads.
[Found on Firefox iOS]
[Real Issue] When keyboard opens, footer pushes up along with it. Footer also doesn't readjust when it closes.

Messenger not scrollable on mobile landscape orientation.
